## Course Description

Digital technology has created new opportunities and resources for mapping, cartography, and geolocation-based visual investigation. It has also brought the need to consider issues concerning power, representation, and space. In this seven-week course, students will be introduced to GIS (geographical information system) basics and learn the practical realities of working with spatial data using digital mapping tools and technologies like mapshaper, Leaflet.js, TileMill, MapBox, and d3.js. Time will also be devoted to investigating the conceptual questions that inform mapping and strategies for counter-mapping. What makes a good map? 

Topics of discussion will include: what do maps represent as visual information artifacts? What happens when we consider maps as art objects? How is the expression of geodata a result of political processes? What does it mean for virtual creations to refer to physical realities, and in what ways do the two shape one another?
Students will work individually on weekly assignments, but will have the opportunity to collaborate on a final project that addresses the techniques and topics studied in the course. This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.To get the most out of this course, students should already have a working understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Office hours are by appointment.

#### Format
Each week will begin with a selection of students presenting assignment from previous week. If there was a reading assigned, the class will start with a brief discussion of it (no laptops open during discussion). presenting their a discussion about concepts raised in  The bulk of the class will be spent introducing and experimenting with more technical mapping methods and tools.

#### Learning Objectives 
- Exposure to broad range of techniques in digital mapping (students should eventually focus on one or two)
- Become conversational in the topics that surround the theory and understanding of cartography and mapping space
- Create maps (or map-based objects) that work as art objects and challenge common conventions or understandings of the capabilities of maps.

#### Resources
There are extra texts in the readings folder that are not required for the course, provided as a resource for students who are interested in delving deeper into mapping concepts.

## Syllabus 
NOTE I: This syllabus will be updated weekly. Bookmark and check often!

NOTE II: All readings can be found in the "Readings" directory. Do the readings! They will be short but useful. The weekly folders contain all materials used in class or necessary for the weekly assignment. 

#### Week One - January 29
About the course, logistics, and each other. 

What is a map? What's the history of mapping? How are maps used in ways that advance agendas? What are the tools involved in digital/web mapping, and what makes it different? 

- Introductions
- Discussion / Viewing: What can mapping do?
- [Very Brief] Lecture: a very quick history of mapping; digital vs physical vs web; how web mapping works; what maps do 
- Demonstration: A simple webmap **ASSIGNMENTS**:
- Create your own map (like the ones that we made in class)
- Go through [this](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#0). 
#### Week Two - February 5
*Tiles and everything you need to know about map projections.*

*Neogeography and questioning geospatial (base layer) data. In depth discussion on geographic data: where it comes from, the forms it takes, how it’s been used in the past, and how to mold it into what we need.*

- Discussion + Homework presentation
- [Very Brief] Lecture: Where geospatial data comes from
-  Demonstration: Finding data, Leaflet.js, TileMill, topoJSON

**ASSIGNMENTS**:
- TK 
- Read: "Know Your Place" chapter from *Dataclysm* 
#### Week Three - February 12
*What should maps communicate?**Adding data to maps. Up until this point, we’ve been concerned with the map as an object. Now we introduce layers and add data to our maps-- both personal (your GPS logs) and large-scale data sets.*
- Discussion + Homework presentation- [Very Brief] Lecture: Origins of web maps, KML vs GeoJSON vs ShapeFiles. QGIS,Mapshaper.- Demonstration: Examples layering different types of data on maps (paying special attention to the relationship between the ground map and the datawe’ve tied to it geographically).
#### Week Four - February 19*Dealing with Data, part 2. What sorts of things shouldn’t be mapped? How do you know if you’re clarifying or making more obscure, and what are the uses of both? Dealing with problems in data, and creating your own. More in-depth continuation of next week.*
- Discussion + Homework presentation- Viewing: Examples of maps that play with the limits of geography
- Demonstration: Techniques for changing data, dealing with issues in the data, and ways to explore the artfulness of problematic data. Using D3 for mapping.
#### Week Five - February 26*Visual Cues, Design Considerations, Animation. How can we use visual cues to tell stories? What are the traditional design rules of maps, and how can we exploit them to create maps that perform other types of work?*
- Discussion + Homework presentation- [Very Brief] Lecture: Final project brief and requirements.- Demonstration: Visual tools for thinking about maps, examples of projects thatuse visual changes for purposes related to art rather than information design(and vice versa). Maps that challenge traditional expectations of space.
#### Week Six - March 4*Experimental Geography* 
- [Very Brief] Overview: Final project, final class.- Guest Lectures: Ann Chen , [TK]
#### Week Seven - March 11*Final Class* 
- Critiquing and Presenting Final Projects
