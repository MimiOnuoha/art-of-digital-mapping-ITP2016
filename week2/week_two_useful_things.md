List all the files in a directory:

		cd ../previousfoldername
		

Navigate to any directory:

		cd ~/foldername
		

Start up a Python local server:   
  

		python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000 

To navigate to it in the browser, go to the url: `localhost:5000`		
To close this server, hit the keys `CTRL + C`.  	

</br></br>Other tips: 

- If you push the `up` arrow, terminal will pull up your previous command
- Similarly, typing `!!` will run the previous command
- Type `history` to see the commands that you've entered in the past. 
- Type `pwd` to see the path name of directory that you're currently in. 
- If you hit the `tab` key while you're entering a pathname, it'll autocomplete it for you.
