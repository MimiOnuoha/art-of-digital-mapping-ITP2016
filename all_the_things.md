## All The Things 

1. I'll be around for office hours from 11am - 1:30pm on Tuesday and 2:00-3:30pm on Wednesday. Sign up for a slot [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUl0bkJBeEw5QmpTfGRlZmF1bHR8MTVmMGJiY2ZkYjkyNWQ0NGQ1Y2YzODliMDQ0MmRlODU). 

2. I added one more short [reading](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/tehran-conf) and one more assignment for this week. The assignment is to sign up for a Mapbox account [here](https://www.mapbox.com/education). The repo README file is updated with this information. 

3. I changed the repo so that now there's a folder called "Resources" where you can find all the information that previously was in the "Useful Things" documents. 

	Check the folder! I added LOTS of information about everything we talked about in class. All the stuff you will need to know to change around geodata is there. 
NOTE: if you struggle with using the python libraries provided, just do things by hand. In class next week we'll go over how to use them. 

4. [OPTIONAL]For those interested in cities and urban space: chapter 2 of Jane Jacobs' *[Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Jacobs%20Part%201.pdf)* is now in the resources folder. 

Enjoy the three day weekend, and stay warm!
